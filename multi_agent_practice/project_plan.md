# Data Analysis Plan: Store Sales Data

**1. Project Goal:**  To understand the performance of different product categories and identify trends in store sales to inform inventory management and marketing strategies.

**2. Key Research Question:**  Which product categories are generating the highest revenue and are exhibiting the most significant growth over the past year?

**3. Data Loading & Cleaning:**

*   **Load the Data:** Use Pandas to load the 'store_sales.csv' dataset into a DataFrame.
*   **Data Type Verification:** Confirm that 'date' is a datetime object, 'units_sold' and 'revenue' are numeric types, and 'product_category' is a string.  If not, correct these data types.
*   **Handle Missing Values:**  Identify and address missing values in 'units_sold' and 'revenue'. Consider imputation (filling missing values with a reasonable estimate, like the mean or median) or removal of rows with too many missing values.  Document the chosen strategy.
*   **Data Standardization/Normalization:** Consider standardizing or normalizing the 'units_sold' and 'revenue' columns to ensure consistency.  This is crucial for some subsequent analyses.
*   **Remove Duplicates:** Identify and remove any duplicate rows.

**4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

*   **Data Aggregation:** Calculate total revenue by product category.
*   **Sales Trend Analysis:**  Create a line chart showing revenue over time (e.g., monthly) for each product category.  This will reveal patterns in sales growth.
*   **Revenue Distribution:**  Calculate the percentage of revenue generated by each product category.
*   **Top Performing Categories:** Identify the top 5 product categories by revenue.
*   **Monthly Sales Trends:** Create a time series plot of 'units_sold' and 'revenue' to visualize sales trends month-over-month.
*   **Correlation Analysis:** Calculate the correlation between 'units_sold' and 'revenue'.  This will help identify potential relationships.
*   **Product Category Growth:**  Calculate the percentage change in revenue for each product category over the past year.  This will pinpoint the most and least growing categories.
*   **Identify Outliers:**  Visually inspect the data for any outliers in 'units_sold' and 'revenue' to see if they represent errors or unusual events.
