    "- **Objective:** In this session, you'll create a small Quarto **website** with multiple pages. This website will showcase data analysis and visualisations using the Titanic dataset. You will then publish this website live on the internet using GitHub Pages.\n",
    "- This practice session focuses on:\n",
    "  - Creating and structuring a Quarto website project.\n",
    "  - Developing content for different pages (text, code, visualizations).\n",
    "  - Configuring website navigation.\n",
    "  - Using Git for version control.\n",
    "  - Publishing your work via GitHub Pages.\n",
    "- **Estimated Time:** 60-75 minutes (publishing can take a few extra minutes for GitHub to build).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Feel free to use any resources you have available (lecture notes, Quarto documentation). \n",
    "- If you get stuck, please ask for help! Searching the web (e.g., for specific Quarto options or Git commands) is also a good idea!"
