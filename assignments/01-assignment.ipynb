However, because of its limitations in size (just being up to 8-bit or 256 unique characters), another system was needed to also encompass characters that existed outside of the English alphabet (e.g., other scripts, accented letters). Therefore, Unicode was developed to address this limitation represent these characters as well as other symbols. Additionally, the first 128 characters in Unicode are the same as those in ASCII, which allows for backwards compatibility."

Compared to other computers at the time, this architecture separated the programs from a machine, in which they were now not inherently a part of the computer itself. The Von Neumann bottleneck is where the processing speed of the CPU exceeds the rate at which the data itself can be sent to the CPU, as data is sent sequentially through a single bus. Therefore, the CPU often waits for data, resulting in downtime and thus suboptimal performanceâ€”computer performance could be increased if transfer speeds to the CPU were equal to the rate at which the CPU can process the data, thus eliminating the bottleneck."

Low-level languages are fast and memory efficient because their capacity to control the memory and processor, but thus have more specific applications and cannot be as widely implemented."

In the context of an image, each pixel of the image is represented as a unique color, which can be represented as a combination of red, green, and blue, which can then be represented as hexadecimal digits. In data analysis and predictive modeling, image-related tasks require more levels to abstraction and thus would be more computationally heavy compared to solely text-related tasks."
